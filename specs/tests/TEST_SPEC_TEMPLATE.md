# Test Specification: [ContractName]

## 1. Test Overview

### Testing Objectives
[What aspects of the contract are being tested and why]

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] 100% Function coverage
- [ ] 100% Branch coverage  
- [ ] All edge cases covered
- [ ] All revert conditions tested

## 2. Unit Tests

### Constructor Tests
- [ ] Valid parameters accepted
- [ ] Zero address rejected
- [ ] Invalid parameters rejected
- [ ] Initial state correctly set

### [FunctionName] Tests

#### Happy Path
- [ ] Test: [Description of normal operation test]
  - Setup: [Initial conditions]
  - Action: [What is executed]
  - Assert: [Expected outcome]

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test: [Edge case 1]
- [ ] Test: [Edge case 2]

#### Revert Cases
- [ ] Test: Reverts when [condition]
  - Expected Error: `[ErrorName]()`
- [ ] Test: Reverts when [condition]
  - Expected Error: `[ErrorName](params)`

#### Access Control
- [ ] Test: Only [role] can call
- [ ] Test: Reverts when called by unauthorized address

### [Additional functions follow the same structure]

## 3. Integration Tests

### Multi-User Scenarios
- [ ] Test: [Scenario description]
  - Users: [Number and roles]
  - Actions: [Sequence of actions]
  - Assertions: [Expected state changes]

### Protocol Interactions
- [ ] Test: [Interaction with external protocol]
- [ ] Test: [Complex multi-step operation]

### Emergency Procedures
- [ ] Test: Pause mechanism stops all operations
- [ ] Test: Emergency withdrawal process
- [ ] Test: Recovery after emergency

## 4. Invariant Tests

### Core Invariants
```solidity
function invariant_[name]() public {
    // Test that [invariant description]
    // Example: assertEq(getTotalBalance(), sumOfAllUserBalances());
}
```

### Invariants to Test
- [ ] [Invariant 1]: [Description]
- [ ] [Invariant 2]: [Description]

## 5. Fuzzing Tests

### Fuzz Targets
- **[functionName]([type] [param])**:
  - Range: [min to max]
  - Properties to check: [What should hold true]
  
### Stateful Fuzzing
- [ ] Random sequence of valid operations maintains invariants
- [ ] No sequence of operations can break core properties

## 6. Security Tests

### Reentrancy Tests
- [ ] Test: No reentrancy in [function]
- [ ] Test: State changes before external calls

### Overflow/Underflow Tests
- [ ] Test: Max values handled correctly
- [ ] Test: Zero values handled correctly

### Front-running Tests
- [ ] Test: [Sensitive operation] resistant to front-running

### Access Control Tests
- [ ] Test: All admin functions restricted
- [ ] Test: Ownership transfer works correctly

## 7. Failure Mode Tests

### External Dependencies
- [ ] Test: Handles oracle failure
- [ ] Test: Handles token transfer failures

## 8. Fork Tests (if applicable)

### Mainnet Fork Tests
- [ ] Test: Integration with [Protocol] on mainnet fork
- [ ] Test: Real token interactions

### Historical State Tests
- [ ] Test: Migration from old contract
- [ ] Test: Upgrade process

## 9. Test Helpers & Utilities

### Mock Contracts
- `Mock[Contract]`: [Purpose]

### Test Setup Functions
```solidity
function setUp() public {
    // Standard test setup
}

function _setupScenario[Name]() internal {
    // Specific scenario setup
}
```

### Common Assertions
```solidity
function _assertInvariant[Name]() internal {
    // Reusable invariant check
}
```

## 10. Test Data

### Test Constants
- [CONSTANT]: [Value] - [Purpose]

### Test Accounts
- Alice: [Role/Purpose]
- Bob: [Role/Purpose]
- Admin: [Role/Purpose]

### Test Amounts
- Small: [Value]
- Medium: [Value]
- Large: [Value]
- Edge: [Value]

## 11. Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
forge test

# Specific contract
forge test --match-contract [ContractName]Test

# Specific test
forge test --match-test test_[functionName]

# With gas report
forge test --gas-report

# With coverage
forge coverage
```

### Expected Results
- All tests should pass
- Coverage should be > [X]%
- Gas usage within benchmarks
