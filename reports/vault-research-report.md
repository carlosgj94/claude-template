# Technical Deep Dive: Best Practices from Leading Vault Implementations

*Research Date: January 2025*

## Executive Summary

After analyzing Yearn V3, Morpho MetaMorpho, Beefy V7, Frax sfrxETH, Balancer V3, and the latest ERC-4626 security patterns, this report synthesizes the most critical technical innovations and patterns for building a world-class vault implementation.

## 1. Architecture Paradigms

### 1.1 Modular Core + Periphery Pattern (Yearn V3, Morpho)

**Key Innovation**: Separation of core vault logic from configurable periphery contracts

```solidity
// Core Vault: Minimal, unopinionated logic
contract VaultCore {
    // Only essential state and logic
    mapping(address => uint256) shares;
    uint256 totalAssets;

    // Delegate to periphery for decisions
    IAccountant accountant;
    IAllocator allocator;
    IGuardian guardian;
}

// Periphery: Customizable modules
contract Accountant {
    // Fee logic separated
    function assessFees() external returns (uint256);
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Core remains immutable and audited once
- Teams can customize behavior without forking
- Upgrades limited to periphery contracts

### 1.2 Tokenized Strategy Pattern (Yearn V3)

**Revolutionary Change**: Strategies themselves are ERC-4626 vaults

```solidity
// V2 Pattern (old):
contract Strategy {
    address immutable vault; // Only one vault can use
}

// V3 Pattern (new):
contract TokenizedStrategy is ERC4626 {
    // Multiple vaults can deposit
    // Users can deposit directly
    // Composable with other protocols
}
```

**Technical Advantages**:

- Capital efficiency: Same strategy serves multiple vaults
- Liquidity aggregation: Direct user deposits possible
- Composability: Strategies can deposit into other strategies

**Note for USDM**: While this tokenized strategy pattern is innovative and offers significant composability benefits, it was not selected for the USDM implementation. The traditional vault-manages-strategies approach provides clearer control flow and simpler security boundaries, which aligns better with USDM's architecture where vaults need direct control over strategy allocations and risk management.

### 1.3 Queue-Based Allocation (Morpho MetaMorpho)

**Pattern**: Ordered queues for capital deployment and withdrawal

```solidity
struct Market {
    address collateral;
    uint256 lltv;
    IOracle oracle;
    uint256 supplyCap;
}

Market[30] public supplyQueue;  // Max 30 markets
Market[30] public withdrawQueue;

function _supplyToMarkets(uint256 amount) internal {
    for (uint i = 0; i < supplyQueue.length; i++) {
        Market memory market = supplyQueue[i];
        uint256 available = market.supplyCap - supplied[market];
        uint256 toSupply = min(amount, available);

        if (toSupply > 0) {
            _supply(market, toSupply);
            amount -= toSupply;
            if (amount == 0) break;
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Granular risk management via supply caps
- Optimized capital deployment
- Flexible rebalancing between markets

**Why Morpho Uses This Pattern**: Morpho Blue operates isolated lending markets (e.g., USDC/WETH 80% LTV, USDC/WBTC 70% LTV). Each market has different yields and risks. The queue system allows MetaMorpho vaults to:
1. Allocate deposits to the highest-yielding markets first (ordered by preference)
2. Respect risk limits via supply caps per market
3. Dynamically rebalance as market conditions change (rates fluctuate)
4. Withdraw from markets in a different order than deposits (optimizing for liquidity)

**Potential USDM V2 Application**: This pattern could be valuable when USDM has multiple yield strategies (Aave, Compound, Morpho) with different risk/return profiles, allowing automatic optimization of capital allocation.

## 2. Share Accounting & Mathematical Precision

### 2.1 Virtual Assets & Shares Defense (OpenZeppelin 2025)

**Critical Security Pattern**: Protection against inflation attacks

```solidity
// Virtual offset approach
contract SecureVault is ERC4626 {
    uint256 constant VIRTUAL_SHARES = 10**3;
    uint256 constant VIRTUAL_ASSETS = 1;

    function _convertToShares(uint256 assets) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return assets.mulDiv(
            totalSupply() + VIRTUAL_SHARES,
            totalAssets() + VIRTUAL_ASSETS,
            Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
    }

    function _convertToAssets(uint256 shares) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return shares.mulDiv(
            totalAssets() + VIRTUAL_ASSETS,
            totalSupply() + VIRTUAL_SHARES,
            Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
    }
}
```

**Why It Works**:

- Virtual shares prevent exchange rate manipulation
- Makes inflation attacks economically unviable
- Maintains precision even with small deposits

**Note**: For a comprehensive explanation of the inflation attack and how virtual shares prevent it, see the detailed security document at `reports/security/vault-decimal-conversion-security.md`

### 2.2 Decimal Offset Pattern

```solidity
// Increase share precision relative to assets
uint8 private immutable _decimalsOffset;

constructor(uint8 decimalsOffset_) {
    _decimalsOffset = decimalsOffset_;
}

function decimals() public view override returns (uint8) {
    return IERC20Metadata(asset()).decimals() + _decimalsOffset;
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Reduces rounding errors
- More granular share representation
- Better handling of small deposits

@claude: Yes, I like this one. In the constructor tho, we can call the ERC20 to know its decimals and based on that calculate the desired decimals offset. Please, document this in the ERC7575Vault spec.

## 3. Access Control & Security Patterns

### 3.1 Multi-Role Governance (Morpho)

**Pattern**: Hierarchical roles with specific powers

```solidity
contract VaultGovernance {
    address public owner;      // Can set fees, upgrade
    address public curator;     // Can add/remove strategies
    address public guardian;    // Can pause, emergency withdraw
    address public allocator;   // Can rebalance only

    modifier onlyRole(address role) {
        require(msg.sender == role, "Unauthorized");
        _;
    }

    // Guardian can veto risky operations
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public pendingOperations;
    uint256 constant TIMELOCK = 24 hours;

    function vetoOperation(bytes32 opId) external onlyRole(guardian) {
        delete pendingOperations[opId];
    }
}
```

@claude: don’t do anything on this regard yet. I’ll take ownership over the ownership/governance problems

### 3.2 Timelock Patterns

**Implementation**: Delay risky operations

```solidity
struct PendingChange {
    uint256 value;
    uint256 validAfter;
}

mapping(address => PendingChange) public pendingCaps;

function proposeSupplyCap(address market, uint256 newCap) external onlyRole(curator) {
    pendingCaps[market] = PendingChange({
        value: newCap,
        validAfter: block.timestamp + TIMELOCK
    });
}

function acceptSupplyCap(address market) external {
    PendingChange memory pending = pendingCaps[market];
    require(block.timestamp >= pending.validAfter, "Timelock active");
    supplyCaps[market] = pending.value;
    delete pendingCaps[market];
}
```

@claude: No need, I’ll add this to the governance layer itself.

## 4. Strategy Management Patterns

### 4.1 Strategy Debt Allocation (Yearn V3)

**Pattern**: Explicit debt tracking per strategy

**Concept**: "Debt" in this context means the amount of capital a vault has allocated to a strategy. It's called "debt" because from the vault's perspective, the strategy "owes" this amount back to the vault.

```solidity
struct StrategyParams {
    uint256 activation;     // Timestamp of activation
    uint256 lastReport;     // Last profit report
    uint256 currentDebt;    // Assets allocated to this strategy
    uint256 maxDebt;        // Maximum allowed allocation
}

mapping(address => StrategyParams) public strategies;

function updateDebt(address strategy, uint256 targetDebt) external onlyRole(allocator) {
    StrategyParams storage params = strategies[strategy];
    uint256 currentDebt = params.currentDebt;

    if (targetDebt > currentDebt) {
        // Increase allocation to strategy
        uint256 toTransfer = targetDebt - currentDebt;
        IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(strategy, toTransfer);
        IStrategy(strategy).invest();
    } else {
        // Decrease allocation (recall funds)
        uint256 toWithdraw = currentDebt - targetDebt;
        IStrategy(strategy).withdraw(toWithdraw);
    }

    params.currentDebt = targetDebt;
}
```

**Why This Matters**:
1. **Precise Accounting**: Vault knows exactly how much each strategy holds
2. **Risk Management**: Can enforce maximum exposure per strategy via `maxDebt`
3. **Rebalancing**: Easy to shift capital between strategies based on performance
4. **Loss Tracking**: If strategy loses money, actual assets < debt (loss detected)
5. **Yield Attribution**: Can track which strategies generate the most profit

**Example Flow**:
- Vault has $10M total, allocates $3M to Aave strategy (debt = $3M)
- Aave generates yield, now holds $3.1M
- Profit = $3.1M - $3M debt = $100k
- Vault can increase debt to $5M if Aave is performing well
- Or reduce debt to $1M if risk increases

### 4.2 Profit Reporting Mechanism

**Purpose**: Regular profit reporting ensures accurate accounting, fee collection, and performance tracking across strategies.

```solidity
function reportProfit(address strategy) external returns (uint256 profit) {
    StrategyParams storage params = strategies[strategy];

    // Get current value held by strategy
    uint256 totalAssets = IStrategy(strategy).totalAssets();
    uint256 debt = params.currentDebt;

    if (totalAssets > debt) {
        // Strategy made profit
        profit = totalAssets - debt;

        // Assess performance fee on profit only
        uint256 performanceFee = profit * feeRate / MAX_BPS;
        IStrategy(strategy).withdraw(performanceFee);
        _mint(feeRecipient, _convertToShares(performanceFee));

        // Update debt to include retained profit
        params.currentDebt = totalAssets - performanceFee;
    } else if (totalAssets < debt) {
        // Strategy has losses
        uint256 loss = debt - totalAssets;
        params.currentDebt = totalAssets; // Reduce debt to actual value
        
        // Emit loss event for monitoring
        emit StrategyLoss(strategy, loss);
    }

    params.lastReport = block.timestamp;
}
```

**Why This Is Critical for USDM**:

1. **Accurate NAV**: Without regular reporting, the vault's perceived value diverges from reality
2. **Fee Collection**: Performance fees are only collected on realized profits via reporting
3. **Loss Detection**: Immediate awareness of strategy losses for risk management
4. **Compound vs Simple Yield**: 
   - With reporting: Profits increase debt, allowing compounding
   - Without: Profits sit idle in strategy, not reinvested
5. **Audit Trail**: Each report creates a checkpoint for accounting verification

**Reporting Frequency Considerations**:
- Too frequent: High gas costs, minimal profit per report
- Too infrequent: Stale pricing, delayed loss detection
- Optimal: Daily to weekly depending on strategy type and yield

**Example Scenario**:
```
Day 1: Deposit $1M to Aave (debt = $1M)
Day 30: Aave position worth $1.01M
Report called:
  - Profit = $10k
  - Fee (10%) = $1k withdrawn and sent to treasury
  - New debt = $1.009M (profit minus fee added to debt)
  - Aave now manages $1.009M (compounding enabled)
```

This pattern ensures transparent, verifiable yield generation with proper fee attribution.

## 5. Gas Optimization Patterns

### 5.1 Transient Storage (Balancer V3)

**Pattern**: Use EIP-1153 for temporary accounting

```solidity
// During complex operations, use transient storage
function complexSwap() external {
    // TSTORE for temporary balance tracking
    assembly {
        tstore(TEMP_BALANCE_SLOT, balance)
    }

    // Multiple operations...

    // TLOAD to retrieve
    assembly {
        let finalBalance := tload(TEMP_BALANCE_SLOT)
    }
}
```

@claude: interesting, would love to know more. How do you think this could apply for a vault instead of a swap tho? Or how could we apply this for USDM?

### 5.2 Packed Storage

```solidity
struct PackedStrategy {
    uint128 debt;        // Current debt
    uint64 lastReport;   // Timestamp
    uint32 performanceFee; // Fee in BPS
    uint32 debtRatio;    // Target allocation
}
// Single storage slot instead of multiple
```

@claude: Nice, but unrelated to vaults

### 5.3 Batch Operations

```solidity
function batchDeposit(
    address[] calldata users,
    uint256[] calldata amounts
) external {
    uint256 totalAmount;
    for (uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        totalAmount += amounts[i];
    }

    // Single asset transfer
    IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);

    // Batch mint shares
    for (uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        _mint(users[i], _convertToShares(amounts[i]));
    }
}
```

@claude: Cool, we may add this to the spec.

## 6. Advanced Features

### 6.1 Boosted Pools with Buffers (Balancer V3)

**Innovation**: 100% capital efficiency via ERC4626 integration

```solidity
contract BoostedVault {
    // Buffer for gas-efficient swaps
    mapping(address => Buffer) public buffers;

    struct Buffer {
        uint256 underlying;  // e.g., USDC
        uint256 wrapped;     // e.g., aUSDC
    }

    function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amount) external {
        Buffer storage buffer = buffers[tokenIn];

        // Try buffer first (no external call)
        if (buffer.underlying >= amount) {
            buffer.underlying -= amount;
            buffer.wrapped += _convertToWrapped(amount);
            return amount;
        }

        // Fall back to unwrapping from protocol
        return _unwrapFromProtocol(amount);
    }
}
```

@claude: I don’t understand what is this.

### 6.2 Cross-Chain Vault Deployments

**Pattern**: Deterministic addresses via CREATE2

```solidity
contract VaultFactory {
    function deployVault(
        bytes32 salt,
        address asset,
        string memory name
    ) external returns (address vault) {
        bytes memory bytecode = abi.encodePacked(
            type(Vault).creationCode,
            abi.encode(asset, name)
        );

        assembly {
            vault := create2(0, add(bytecode, 0x20), mload(bytecode), salt)
        }

        // Same address on all chains
    }
}
```

@claude: Not super interested in this in particular, but super interested in researching how can we achieve a crosschain vault in which users can deposit from any L2 that has been deployed and whitelisted. Potentially there may be a single accounting chain, but deposits should happen from any chain. Please remove the create2 need.

### 6.3 Hooks Framework (Balancer V3)

```solidity
interface IVaultHooks {
    function beforeDeposit(address user, uint256 assets) external returns (bool);
    function afterDeposit(address user, uint256 shares) external;
    function beforeWithdraw(address user, uint256 shares) external returns (bool);
    function afterWithdraw(address user, uint256 assets) external;
}

contract HookableVault {
    IVaultHooks public hooks;

    function deposit(uint256 assets) external {
        if (address(hooks) != address(0)) {
            require(hooks.beforeDeposit(msg.sender, assets), "Hook rejected");
        }

        uint256 shares = _deposit(assets);

        if (address(hooks) != address(0)) {
            hooks.afterDeposit(msg.sender, shares);
        }
    }
}
```

@claude: Nice, I like this, create a section on the ERC7575Vault spec about these sort of internal functions.

## 7. Critical Security Considerations

### 7.1 Reentrancy Protection Patterns

```solidity
contract SecureVault {
    uint256 private constant UNLOCKED = 1;
    uint256 private constant LOCKED = 2;
    uint256 private locked = UNLOCKED;

    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(locked == UNLOCKED, "Reentrant call");
        locked = LOCKED;
        _;
        locked = UNLOCKED;
    }

    // Alternative: OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
    // But custom implementation saves gas
}
```

### 7.2 Emergency Patterns

```solidity
contract EmergencyVault {
    bool public emergencyShutdown;

    modifier whenNotShutdown() {
        require(!emergencyShutdown, "Vault shutdown");
        _;
    }

    function emergencyWithdraw() external {
        require(emergencyShutdown, "Not in emergency");
        uint256 shares = balanceOf(msg.sender);
        uint256 assets = _convertToAssets(shares);

        // Proportional withdrawal from all strategies
        for (uint i = 0; i < strategies.length; i++) {
            uint256 strategyShare = assets * strategyAllocations[i] / TOTAL_BPS;
            IStrategy(strategies[i]).emergencyWithdraw(strategyShare);
        }

        _burn(msg.sender, shares);
        IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, assets);
    }
}
```

@claude: Document this in the spec, I’m unsure this is a good idea, but I want to think about it. Don’t add it as something definitive, but something that we need to think about

### 7.3 Oracle Manipulation Protection

```solidity
contract OracleSecureVault {
    uint256 constant MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION = 500; // 5%
    uint256 public lastPrice;

    function updatePrice(uint256 newPrice) external {
        uint256 deviation = abs(newPrice - lastPrice) * 10000 / lastPrice;
        require(deviation <= MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION, "Price manipulation detected");

        lastPrice = newPrice;
    }

    // Use multiple oracle sources
    function getPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 chainlinkPrice = IChainlink(chainlink).latestPrice();
        uint256 uniswapTWAP = IUniswapV3(pool).observe();

        // Ensure prices are within acceptable range
        require(abs(chainlinkPrice - uniswapTWAP) < threshold, "Oracle mismatch");

        return (chainlinkPrice + uniswapTWAP) / 2;
    }
}
```

## 8. Mathematical Formulas & Precision

@claude: Love this section, please add this to your #memory , that I’d like to see more of this in the future. Mathematical correction is critical. Should be added in the invariant tests as well.
Also, I’ll need the calculations to know the yield generated. Although that might not happen on chain

### 8.1 Share Price Calculation

**Standard Formula**:

```solidity
sharePrice = (totalAssets + 1) * 10^decimals / (totalSupply + 10^(_decimalsOffset))
```

**With Virtual Offsets**:

```solidity
sharePrice = (totalAssets + VIRTUAL_ASSETS) * 10^decimals / (totalSupply + VIRTUAL_SHARES)
```

@claude: Still need to understand this better

### 8.2 Deposit Share Calculation

```solidity
shares = assets * (totalSupply + VIRTUAL_SHARES) / (totalAssets + VIRTUAL_ASSETS)
```

### 8.3 Withdrawal Asset Calculation

```solidity
assets = shares * (totalAssets + VIRTUAL_ASSETS) / (totalSupply + VIRTUAL_SHARES)
```

### 8.4 Fee Calculations

**Performance Fee**:

```solidity
feeShares = profit * performanceFeeRate * totalSupply / (totalAssets * MAX_BPS - profit * performanceFeeRate)
```

**Management Fee (time-based)**:

```solidity
annualFeeShares = totalSupply * managementFeeRate * timeElapsed / (SECONDS_PER_YEAR * MAX_BPS)
```
